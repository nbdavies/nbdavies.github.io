			<h4>A Little About Me</h4>
			<section class="right">
			<p><em>Where I'm from</em></p>
			<p>I grew up in the Washington, DC area, moved to Chicago for college, and now call Madison, WI home.</p>
			<p><em>My Interests</em></p>
			<p>I play music, currently in the band <a href="http://gentlebrontosaurus.bandcamp.com">Gentle Brontosaurus</a>, and previously in <a href="http://tldr.bandcamp.com">TL;DR</a>. I play keyboard and pocket trumpet, and I'm halfway decent on electric bass or guitar.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="left">
			<p>I read and write speculative fiction, and regularly participate in NaNoWriMo. So basically, even when I'm not programming, you can generally find me at some type of keyboard.</p>
			<p>My other hobbies include board games, video games, biking, and skiing.</p>
			<p><em>Education and Experience</em></p>
			<p>At the University of Chicago, I majored in physics, and also made time for Russian language and literature. In human languages, I also studied Latin for many years, and conversational Spanish and German.</p>
			<p>In terms of programming languages, I started my journey early on, teaching myself BASIC, and enough HTML to put together a Geocities page. In highschool, I learned a little Kobol, ForTran, and Visual Basic. In college, I learned Python. And then working in a technical services role at Epic, I learned Cache/M, more Visual Basic, and a bit SQL and Perl. Now with DBC, I'm learning more HTML and CSS, Ruby, and much more!</p>

				<p><em>Something Quirky</em></p>
				<p>If you ever want to bribe me with candy, I especially enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salty_liquorice">salty licorice</a>. It puts the "mm!" in ammonium chloride.</p>
