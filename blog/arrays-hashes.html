      <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes in Ruby</h2>
      <h4>11/13/2015</h4>
      <p>Let's start by defining an example array in Ruby:</p>
      <pre>
array = ["z", 1, "a", -5.6]</pre>
      <p>This sets the first four elements of the array to those values. In other words, it's equivalent to writing this:</p>
      <pre>
array[0] = "z"
array[1] = 1
array[2] = "a"
array[3] = -5.6</pre>
      <p>But maybe you don't want to define your index values implicitly like that. Counting up is a bit boring. Let's look at a few odd cases. I'll add a couple more values to my array, while specifying the index number:</p>
      <pre>
array[5]="Hi"
array[1.2]=false
array[-3]="-3"
array[-2.1]="yawn"
      </pre>
      <p>Now the contents of my array are:</p>
      <pre>
["z", false, "a", "-3", "yawn", "Hi"]</pre>
      <p>What happened was:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I specified the fifth entry in the array, which meant there had to be a fourth entry. By default, its value is nil.</li>
        <li>I specified the 1.2th entry to be boolean value false. Naturally, the 1.2th value goes between the first and the second. Anytime I ask for the 1.2th value in this array, it'll return false. I just have to remember it's there.</li>
        <li>Then I specified the -3rd value in the array. -1 would be the last value in the array, and so on. So it replaced the third-from-last value with "-3", which is a string, not a number.</li>
        <li>Then I specified the -2.1th element. But it does not allow in-between elements when you're counting backwards, so "yawn" was stored in element -2, aka element 4.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now that you've got the basics of how arrays look and act in Ruby, let's look at a hash, which is a data structure you might not have encountered in other languages. If you want to be really dull, you can make your hash look just like an array:</p>
      <pre>
hash[0]="z"
hash[1]=1
hash[2]="a"
hash[3]=-5.6
{0=>"z", 1=>1, 2=>"a", 3=>-5.6}</pre>
      <p>Notice that to do this you do have to specify both the keys and the values, whereas arrays could pick the indexes for you. This is because the hash can't make any assumptions about what you want inside the brackets.</p>
      <p>Now let's try some of the weird stuff we did to the array, and see what happens to the hash.</p>
      <pre>
hash[5]="Hi"
hash[1.2]=false
hash[-3]="-3"
hash[-2.1]="yawn"
{0=>"z", 1=>1, 2=>"a", 3=>-5.6, 5=>"Hi", 1.2=>false, -3=>"-3", -2.1=>"yawn"}</pre>
      <p>Absolutely nothing weird happened. Kind of disappointing, right? It handled those 4 additional key+value pairs the exact same way it handled the previous four, and has them listed in the order I added them. Again, with a Hash, because the keys can be any type of value, Ruby can't make any assumptions about how you want the elements of your hash ordered. If you want a hash sorted, you need to sort it yourself. It doesn't have the handy tricks for starting at the end, or adding an element in between, though you can absolutely do those things with code. The key values didn't even need to be numbers, which would absolutely not fly in an array:</p>
      <pre>
hash["Chicken of the Woods"]="Laetiporus sulphureus" 
hash["Hen of the Woods"]="Grifola frondosa"</pre>
      <p>Hashes and arrays both have their strengths and weaknesses. One way to think of it would be: if you were writing out the information you're going to store, would you use a numbered list, or a bulleted list? If you'd write it as a numbered list, then you may be better off with an array. If you would write it as a bulleted or unordered list, or as more of a glossary, then you may be better off using a hash.</p>
