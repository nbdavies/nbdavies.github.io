      <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes in Ruby</h2>
      <h3>What to do when, like Dwight, you have too many keys to know what to do with</h3>
      <h4>11/13/2015</h4>
      <p>That subtitle was a reference to The Office, or so I'm told.</p><p>
      Let's talk about arrays and hashes in Ruby. Maybe you're familiar with arrays from math class. Maybe you think you know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">what a hash is</a>. Time to un-learn that.</p>
      <h4>Arrays the drawbridge!</h4>
      <p>Describing these things doesn't work very well, so why don't I just show you. The following is an array in Ruby:</p>
      <code class="language-ruby"><pre>
array = ["z", 1, "a", -5.6]</pre></code>
      <p>Another way to write the same array would be:</p>
      <code class="language-ruby"><pre>
array[0] = "z"
array[1] = 1
array[2] = "a"
array[3] = -5.6</pre></code>
      <p>That's straightforward, right? A little too straightforward. So let's show you a couple of odd cases. I'll add a couple more values to my array, while specifying the index number:</p>
      <code class="language-ruby"><pre>
array[5]="Hi"
array[1.2]=false
array[-3]="-3"
array[-2.1]="yawn"
      </pre></code>
      <p>Now the contents of my array are:</p>
      <code class="language-ruby"><pre>
["z", false, "a", "-3", "yawn", "Hi"]</pre></code>
      <p>What happened was:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I specified the fifth entry in the array, which meant there had to be a fourth entry. But by default, its value is nil.</li>
        <li>I specified the 1.2th entry to be boolean value false. The 1.2th value goes between the first and the second, naturally. Anytime I ask for the 1.2th value in this array, it'll return false. I should just try not to forget that it's there.</li>
        <li>Then I specified the -3rd value in the array. -1 would be the last value in the array, and so on. So it replaced the third-from-last value with "-3", which is a string, not a number, FYI.</li>
        <li>Then I specified the -2.1th element. But it does not allow in-between elements when you're counting backwards, so "yawn" was stored in element -2, aka element 4.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>I can hash cheezburger</h4>
      <p>Now that you've got the basics of what an array can look like, I'll show you a hash. You've made it this far, and endured my puns, so you deserve it.</p>
      <code class="language-ruby"><pre>
hash[0]="z"
hash[1]=1
hash[2]="a"
hash[3]=-5.6
{0=>"z", 1=>1, 2=>"a", 3=>-5.6}</pre></code>
      <p>So you can create the same data structure as you have in the array, but to do it, you have to specify the key and the value, something that was optional with the array.</p>
      <p>Now let's try some of the weird stuff we did to the array, and see what happens to the hash.</p>
      <code class="language-ruby"><pre>
hash[5]="Hi"
hash[1.2]=false
hash[-3]="-3"
hash[-2.1]="yawn"
{0=>"z", 1=>1, 2=>"a", 3=>-5.6, 5=>"Hi", 1.2=>false, -3=>"-3", -2.1=>"yawn"}</pre></code>
      <p>Absolutely nothing weird happened. Kind of disappointing, right? It handled those 4 additional key+value pairs the exact same way it handled the previous four, and has them listed in the order I added them. If you want a hash sorted, you need to make the sorting happen. It doesn't have the handy tricks for starting at the end, or adding an element in between. The key values didn't even need to be numbers, which would absolutely not fly in an array:</p>
      <code class="language-ruby"><pre>
hash["Chicken of the Woods"]="Laetiporus sulphureus" 
hash["Hen of the Woods"]="Grifola frondosa"</pre></code>
      <h4>Anything you can do, I can do better</h4>
      <p>When do you use an array vs. a hash? They both have their strengths and weaknesses. One way to think of it would be: if you were writing out the information you're going to store, would you use a numbered list, or a bulleted list? If you'd write it as a numbered list, then you may be better off with an array. If you would write it as a bulleted or unordered list, or as more of a glossary, then you may be better off using a hash.</p>
