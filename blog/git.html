      Why version control?
      No one gives birth to an adult. (Thank goodness, right?) Maybe you think the first version of your code got everything right. No bugs? Never going to add features later? Will it continue to work forever, as people upgrade their operating systems or their browsers? Things can get complicated pretty quickly, and if you want any help, you'll have multiple people contributing to the code at once. You need some system for keeping track of what changed in each version, and a way to go back to old versions or have multiple versions in the works at once.

      How git helps...
      All the code for your project gets stored in a directory, and git keeps track of what changes you make to files in that directory. You can create code branches to try something out without messing up your master copy. Git lets you switch seemlessly between them, without having to manage all those copies of your code yourself.

      What about GitHub?
      As the name suggests, GitHub can function as a central online repository for your code and history of your code changes, and those of other people contributing to the same code. It can also be how you release your code to the public, or as a backup in case you drop  your laptop into lava.
