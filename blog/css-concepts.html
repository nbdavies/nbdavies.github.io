      <h2>CSS Display Attribute: Don't Leave Home Without It!</h2>
      <h4>11/8/2015</h4>
      <p>Everything in CSS controls how things display, so why is there an attribute called "display", and what does it do?</p>
      <p>When you load an webpage, all the elements on that page line up, starting at the top left corner of the page. It's sort of like lining up in the jetway to get on a plane. All elements have a default for how they behave in line. Things like bullet points don't want anything next to them, so their display behavior is "block". But normal text, like a link or a span tag, those expect to be used in the context of a paragraph where text will continue on the same line, so their behavior is "inline".</p>
      <p>But you can change this behavior, and tell a span to display as a "block", which would be one way of adding a linebreak after it. Or telling a div to display as inline-block, so that it still takes up a block of space, but allows other elements next to it. There's also a "none" value, which makes it so that the element doesn't display or take up any space at all, something you might use to dynamically add and remove elements from view.</p>
      <p>This is the tip of the iceberg though. There are display values for lists, tables, etc., which is how those HTML elements display by default, but you could go crazy and make your lists display like tables and vice versa, if you had some good reason for wanting to do that. For most purposes, you can probably get by with "block", "inline", "inline-block", and "none".</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Now let's look at a page that you probably see every day, your "new tab" in Chrome. It's got some links to frequently visited sites like this:</p>
      <img src="../imgs/css-fig-1.png" alt="4 x 2 grid">
      <p>It behaves this way because for each thumbnail, display="inline-block". If we use Inspect Element to change this to just "block", we can see that they get arrayed vertically:</p>
      <img src="../imgs/css-fig-2.png" alt="1 x 8 grid">
      <p>And if we change it to "inline", we can see that they're all put in a row, but they aren't treated as distinct blocks anymore:</p>
      <img src="../imgs/css-fig-3.png" alt="jumbled mess">
      <p>And if we change it to "none", well, there isn't anything to show for that.</p>
      <p>I hope this has been useful. Please contact me if you have any questions or corrections about this post.</p>
