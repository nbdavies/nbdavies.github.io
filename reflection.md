What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

It reenforced things I had learned earlier in the week. Padding is the amount of space between the content (text, image, etc.) and the edge of the element (where the border would go). Then the border goes around the edge of the element, and the margin is the amount of space that must be between the element's border and any other elements.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

The position parameter is something that I'm still playing around with as I go, and finding the right values by trial and error. For example, on my index page, I had to use "absolute" positioning to make the text start from the top (to the right of the image), while on my blog index page, I had to use relative positioning instead, to make sure that the border for the "main" tag would include it.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The biggest difficulty was what I described in the previous section. I ended up resolving it by applying different positioning for "article" when it is a sibling to an image (img + article). Colors weren't too hard to add, but I don't particularly like the ones I have now, or any of the other templates I checked out. 

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

In addition to the above, I also tried to make my navigation bar look something like the buttons in my wireframe. Getting my links to all have the same dimensions required changing their display to "inline-block".
The fact that you could invoke multiple CSS files makes sense conceptually, but I hadn't really thought about it before. I haven't had to change the styling for the blog too much so far.
