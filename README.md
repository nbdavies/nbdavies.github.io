I first created this site during Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, in fall 2015, using basic HTML/CSS.

Since then, it's gone through several iterations of content, technologies, and styling. Now it's using Jekyll and Bootstrap. I've reset it back to a basic style, while I consider what I want it to look like, or what other features I want to include.
