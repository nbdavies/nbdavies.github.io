# Writer
I've been participating in [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/ndavies) in November, since at least 2006 or so, and I appreciate Madison's community around it. I'm also fortunate to have a regular critique group that's been meeting every month since 2007.

In May 2020, I volunteered with the first Flights of Foundry, an online, worldwide convention. I'm looking forward to helping out with it again in sping 2021. In normal years, you can also find me at WisCon. I look forward to getting to more cons in future.

I've always got something in progress. Currently it's a "Silence of the Lambs" x "The Prestige" epistolary novel. I'm also planning to polish up some short stories soon.
