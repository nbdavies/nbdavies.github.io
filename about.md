## More about me

I grew up in the Washington, DC area. I'm an alum of St. Anselms Abbey School and University of Chicago. Since 2007, Madison, WI has been my home, where I currently live with my partner and our cat. (Please check out [the cat's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/idithecat/)!)

When I'm not in front of some sort of keyboard or other, I enjoy biking, reading, and experimenting in the kitchen.
