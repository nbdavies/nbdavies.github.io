## More about me

I grew up in the DC area, where I graduated from St. Anselms Abbey School. In 2007, I graduated from the University of Chicago. Madison, WI has been my home since then, where I currently live with my partner and cat.

When I'm not in front of some sort of keyboard or other, I enjoy biking, reading, and experimenting in the kitchen.
