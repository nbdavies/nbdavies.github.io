title: "Making of Evacuation's Out: Vocals"
---
On August 9, I released my third album as Spiral Island, [Evacuation's Out](spiralisland.bandcamp.com). In my next few blog posts, I'll share some of what went into this album, starting with vocals.

# Recording

All of the songs on this album originally came out of [February Album Writing Month](fawm.org), and I had rough demos to iterate on. But the demo vocals generally weren't worth keeping, because when I recorded those demos, I was finding the melody in real-time, and singing quietly because it was 11pm by the time I wrote lyrics. As a result, 99% of the vocals got re-recorded, and parts got added over time.

(There was one vocal track I didn't redo, the "echo" vocal on _In de Woestijn_. I liked it better unpolished, and as a subtle Easter egg that it's not actually a delay of the lead vocal.)

# Acoustics: I refuse

My home studio is in the corner of a rectangular room that's about 10' x 15'. Aside from my junk, there's not much to absorb reflections. I don't have a great ear for acoustics, but I know that the acoustics in the room are garbage. Besides that, there's a window facing the street and a vent for the radiator and AC.

The acoustics are something that I don't feel qualified to fix or even judge, really, so I've tried to just avoid them altogether. The sound of an acoustically pleasing space is something I can always add later, in the mix.

I use a Shure SM7B, for that sweet NPR tone and its focused cardioid pattern. It's mounted on a standing desk, so that I can sing standing up and have my laptop at that level to punch in / punch out.

For lead vocals, I get pretty close to the mic, and for backing vocals, especially when I need to hit high notes, I'll back up a couple feet and project more. The mic has a proximity effect that picks up more low-end when you sing close, so I typically EQ out any frequencies below the fundamental note of what I'm singing (200-400hz).

In addition to EQ, I'll typically use a de-esser, compression to tame the dynamics, and auto-tune. At the end, the vocal will be routed to reverb and/or delay buses. But I'll get into that more later, in my post about mixing the album.

# Auto-tune

Recording my Spiral Island albums has been an opportunity to try out new studio tricks and technologies. On my previous album, I did things like use pitch shift to reach melodies I couldn't sing otherwise. I used a sample-based vocal synth to fill the role of a gospel choir, and a Yamaha vocaloid to reach notes too low for me. 

The vocals on that album were all tuned as well, using Reaper's factory default ReaTune, but without a lot of hand-editing. Listening back to it nowadays, I don't think I quite achieved the slick pop sound I was going for, and this is one reason why.

Starting on this album, I wanted to make songs that were energetic and digital, and to have vocals matching that vibe. So I did a shoot-out of all the auto-tune options I could find at the time:
* Melodyne
* Nectar
* Waves Tune Real-time
* ReaTune
* bx_crispytuner
* Voloco
* Little AlterBoy
* Antares Auto-Tune Pro
* RePitch

I could write another blog post on my impressions of all these, but for this album I settled on bx_crispytuner. 

This was one of the more artificial-sounding plugins I tried, which I was more comfortable with on this album: the goal was to make catchy songs, not necessarily to fool anybody about my singing abilities. 

It also does something to the vocal timbre, which I actually like on my vocals. And it does a pretty good job of figuring out what note you're aiming for, which reduces the work of hand-editing it the rest of the way there.

# How I used auto-tune

With a home recording project like this, I just kept doing takes until I had what I wanted, as close to the target notes as I can get. So generally all the notes you hear, I sang as best I could.

Even the low parts on _Cinemascope_--I sung those notes and then shifted the formant to make it sound like it was pitched down, but it's not. (The rap verse on _Wij Bevonden Ons_ uses a similar effect.)

One exception would be the harmony on _Perfect Imagining_, which is a pitched-up copy of the lead vocal. Harmonies made this way often get lost in the mix, and end up sounding like overtones/undertones of the lead vocal, but in this song's arrangement, I needed the timing to be an exact match.

# Other vocalish stuff

The gang vocals on _I'm Gonna Sleep_ were just multiple tracks of me doing grunty voices.

_Wij Bevonden Ons_ also includes a bit of Chipspeech. While I used a vocal synth for a gospel choir on the last album, I think these days, with the proliferation of deceptive AI-based tools, I'd maybe rather inlist actual backing singers, or use a more obvious fake, like Yamaha Vocaloid or Chipspeech.
