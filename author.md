# Nick Davies as an Author

I've been participating in [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/ndavies) in November, since at least 2006 or so, and I participate in Madison's NaNoWriMo community. I'm also fortunate to have a regular critique group that's been meeting monthly since 2007.

In spring 2020 and 2021, I volunteered with [Flights of Foundry](https://flights-of-foundry.org/), an online, worldwide convention. This year I helped organize the virtual dealer's room. I also typically WisCon, and I look forward to going to more cons in future.

I'm always writing or revising something. At the moment, it's a project code-named "The Enthrallers", an epistolary novel, sort of like "Silence of the Lambs" x "The Prestige". I've also been writing more short stories recently. I'm looking forward to polishing those up soon.
