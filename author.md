## Background

I've been participating in [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/ndavies) in November, since at least 2006 or so, and I participate in Madison's NaNoWriMo community. I'm also fortunate to have a critique group that's been meeting monthly since 2007.

I'm always writing or revising something. At the moment, I have an epistolary novel in progress, code-named "The Enthrallers". Think "Silence of the Lambs" x "The Prestige".
